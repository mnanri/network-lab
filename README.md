## Accuracy and Number of Labeled Nodes
Under constant number of whole nodes, figures show the relation between number of labeled nodes and accuracy.
```
whole nodes: 1000x4
ratio of nodes used in links: top 10% in order of degree centrality
rule of labeling: degree centrality
duration a sample (average of 10 times): 6302 sec
```
```
whole nodes: 400x4
ratio of nodes used in links: top 10% in order of degree centrality
rule of labeling: degree centrality
duration for a sample (average of 10 times): 1018 sec
```
```
whole nodes: 400x4
ratio of nodes used in links: top 10% in order of degree centrality
rule of labeling: degree centrality order reversed (asc)
duration for a sample (average of 10 times): 1110 sec
```
```
whole nodes: 1000x4
ratio of nodes used in links: top 10% in order of degree centrality
